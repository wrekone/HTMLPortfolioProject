    I'm an aspiring security professional focused on application security.
    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>Graduate of the Cybersecurity & Networking program at Mt. Hood
      Community College. As an Oregon native, I spent my early years on the
      North coast and have lived in Portland for 20 years. Most of my free
      time is spent working in the garden, playing with my three daughters,
      and reading about security. My favorite thing to do is to fix things.
      I like to figure out how something works and see if I can make it work
      again. I'm at my best when my hands are getting dirty.</p>
